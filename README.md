# Kill Howdy
## Changes the text **Howdy** in the admin interface to a different greeting.

Yesterday, a client told me that he was sick of starring at "Howdy" in the Wordpress admin interface.

He told me it made him want to punch his computer in the face.

He asked me if I could replace it with something like "Hello, Your Majesty"

After I stopped laughing and picked myself up off the floor, I coded this plugin that will change Howdy to a different, random greeting.
